Welcome to Sunway Tech Club's HacktoberFest repo!

This is where you can find the profile of others, which had their pull requests approved in [Profiles](/profiles/).

Want your profile in here too? Come on over to [our repo](https://github.com/sunwaytechclub/hacktoberfest-2019) and ask one of us on how to make your very first pull request if you don't know how!

## Getting your Pull Request (PR) accepted

Other than the commands/buttons needed to get your PR sent to us, many repos out there in the wild will require you to follow certain guidelines to ensure a certain form of standard to their repo.

It is no different here, although our rules are certainly more relaxed than the others ;)

You need to make sure that your PR fulfils the following requirements when you are submitting your profile:

1. Your profile must be in `md` extension, and must be in `_posts` folder
2. The name of your file must be in YYYY-M-D-title-name format, where you replace spaces with dashes. *Example: 2019-9-18-Making-Your-First-PR*
3. The top of your file's content must have the following, where:
  - layout **must** be *post*
  - title can be anything you want to be. *Example: Making Your First PR*
  - The `---` must be wrapped above and below the `layout` and `title`
  - ![Front Matter Example](/images/front-matter-example.png)
4. If images are used in your profile, it can be a direct link to it, if you want to add the image to our repo, please add it to `images` folder
  - ![Images Folder](/images/images-folder.png)
  - Images can then be linked with `/images/name-of-your-image`
