My name is Sean! I am an example here on how your Markdown Profile should look like.

You can use an assortment of Markdown formatting, just ask around and STC will assist you ;)

For example, you can use codes with `\``,` so it'll show up as `hello` rather than hello

Or you can use block quotes with `>`, like this!
> Hello world!

Finally, here's an image of me!

Don't forget that you can check the source of this profile in the repo, as an example on what you can do in Markdown :D
